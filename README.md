# Mini Compiler / Language Interpreter

## Description
This project is a mini compiler / interpreter for the **Cleaning World Language**, a small educational language used to express and solve simple computational problems.

The system processes programs written in the Cleaning World Language from source code to execution by implementing the main stages of language processing: lexical analysis, parsing, construction of concrete and abstract syntax trees (CST and AST), semantic analysis, and interpretation.


## Project Scope
The project covers the main phases of a compiler/interpreter:
- Lexical analysis (tokenization)
- Parsing and syntax checking
- Construction of syntax trees (CST and AST)
- Basic semantic analysis
- Interpretation of a small language

## Key Concepts
- Formal grammars
- Abstract Syntax Trees (AST)
- Concrete Syntax Trees (CST)
- Semantic rules
- Interpretation

## Technologies & Languages
- Programming language theory concepts
- Functional and logic programming techniques (ML / Prolog / Lisp where applicable)

## What I Learned
- How programming languages are designed and executed
- The role of syntax vs semantics
- How interpreters process and evaluate programs

## Future Improvements
- Extend the grammar with more language features
- Add error handling and better diagnostics
- Visualize the AST structure
