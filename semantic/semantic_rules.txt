Semantic Rules

E_DUP_DECL:
  Duplicate declaration of a name in the same scope.

E_UNDEFINED:
  Use of a name that has not been declared.

E_CONST_ASSIGN:
  Attempting to reassign a value to a constant (e.g., const MAX = 5; MAX = 10;).

The analyzer applies declaration, resolution, and type-checking passes
to detect these conditions.
